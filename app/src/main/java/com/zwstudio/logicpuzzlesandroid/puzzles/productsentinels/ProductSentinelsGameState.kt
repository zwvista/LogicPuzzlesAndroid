       Summary
       Multiplicative Towers

       Description
       1. On the Board there are a few sentinels. These sentinels are marked with
          a number.
       2. The number tells you the product of the tiles that Sentinel can control
          (see) from there vertically and horizontally. This includes the tile
          where he is located.
       3. You must put Towers on the Boards in accordance with these hints, keeping
          in mind that a Tower blocks the Sentinel View.
       4. The restrictions are that there must be a single continuous Garden, and
          two Towers can't touch horizontally or vertically.
       5. Towers can't go over numbered squares. But numbered squares don't block
          Sentinel View.
